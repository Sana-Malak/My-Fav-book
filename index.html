        <p class="para">My hobby is reading interesting and knowledgeable books in my free time. Whenever I go to home from my school I like to read such books after completing my home work. I am 9 years old and read in class 4th standard. Now I know very well that reading is very good habit which can make me a complete. This hobby can be developed by anyone however I got this naturally. Reading books keep one always happy and busy. It is the good source of enjoyment, knowledge, inspiration and instruction. It makes us disciplined, loyal, punctual and most importantly a successful person in the life.

            Mahesh Das, known as Raja Birbal, was an advisor in the court of Mughal Emperor Akbar. The tales of his wit are legendary and possibly told to every child as a folk tale. This book starts with how Akbar met Birbal. The emperor was once lost in a forest and came to an intersection with three roads. Not knowing which road led back to his city, and facing a dilemma, he saw a young man coming down one of the roads. The manner of the young man’s reply endeared him to the Emperor who offered him a place in his court.
            I was glad to read this particular snippet, as I didn’t know of the way they met. Most books I’ve read on this subject would cover particular stories of Birbal’s wit, but not this first meeting with Akbar. Going further, I happily returned to the world that these tales created for me when I was young. As I read every word, the pictures from old comics started to slowly form again in my imagination. Like the tale of counting the number of crows in Agra; or how Birbal showed the folly in Akbar’s sudden belief in the superstition about the first face one saw in the day. One of my favorite stories narrated the way Birbal helped catch a thief with pieces of bamboo. Another favorite story is about how Birbal finds the mother tongue of a linguist. These are, to me, timeless tales that I can read over and over and over again.
